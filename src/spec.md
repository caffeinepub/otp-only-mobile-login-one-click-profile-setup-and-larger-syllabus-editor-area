# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current logo with the uploaded circular logo and ensure proper sizing and circular styling in the header.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace existing logo assets with the uploaded circular logo (cropped_circle_image.png)
- Adjust logo size in the Header component to be appropriately scaled
- Apply circular styling with CSS (rounded-full) to maintain circular appearance
- Generate logo variants in multiple sizes for different use cases (header, favicons, touch icons)

**User-visible outcome:** The header displays a properly sized, circular red logo with white 'EX' letters that looks balanced and professional across all devices.
