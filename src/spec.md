# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore Exam Xpresss to Draft Version 64 and redeploy it as a new draft so development can continue from Version 64 (instead of the currently deployed Draft Version 68).

**Planned changes:**
- Restore the application codebase and configuration to match Draft Version 64.
- Redeploy the restored Version 64 as a new draft.
- Fix any build/deployment blockers encountered so the Version 64 frontend build and backend canister deploy complete successfully and core pages render (Home, Mock Tests, Courses, Syllabus, Profile).

**User-visible outcome:** A newly deployed draft that matches Draft Version 64 loads successfully in the browser, deploys without errors, and core pages open without crashing.
