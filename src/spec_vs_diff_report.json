  "summary": "Branding updates are evident in Header/Footer (logo path and English “Exam Xpresss” text), but there is no evidence that the required generated image assets were added under frontend/public/assets/generated. There is also insufficient evidence that favicon/app icons were generated and wired up, and that the build/deployment failure was fully resolved. Several unrelated/extra changes appear to have been introduced (e.g., sitemap, Google verification, significant auth/session and UX changes).",

      "reason": "The UI references /assets/generated/exam-xpresss-logo-clean.dim_512x512.png, but the diff summary shows no added static asset files and provides no evidence that the required PNG actually exists under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
