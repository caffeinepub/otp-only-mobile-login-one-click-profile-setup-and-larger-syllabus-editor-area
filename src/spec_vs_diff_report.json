  "summary": "Diff introduces a Draft Version 64 build label and a number of frontend/UI/UX and configuration changes. It does not provide evidence that the codebase/configuration was actually restored to match the historical Draft Version 64, nor does it provide evidence of successful IC deployment/build completion. Several unrequested features/changes (branding/theme consolidation, sitemap/favicon, admin editor UI changes, error boundary/routing/auth behavior changes) appear to go beyond a “restore/redeploy only” request.",
