  "summary": "The diff demonstrates implementation of logo resizing and circular styling in the Header component. REQ-1 (logo replacement) is partially addressed through filename references, but actual asset generation/upload is not visible in the diff. REQ-2 (circular styling and sizing) is fully implemented with rounded-full CSS and 64x64 sizing.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace the current logo image with the uploaded circular logo (cropped_circle_image.png) in all sizes",
      "reason": "The diff shows references to generated logo assets (logo-header.dim_64x64.png, favicon files in index.html), but does not show the actual image files being added or replaced. The ADDED FILES section shows 'none', indicating no new image assets were committed.",
